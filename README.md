This C++ project implements a comprehensive election data analysis system that allows users to input voting records and in return are provided with detailed results at national, state, and candidate-specific levels.

Features
Voting Records Input: Users can input voting data with .txt files, which is then processed to generate election results.
Specific Data Analyis: Users can input the type of data they want to recieve, for example can choose from country results, democratic party results, state results, or specific presidential candidate results.
Object-Oriented Design: Custom Votes and Candidate classes are implemented to model and manage election-related data efficiently.
Sorting Algorithms: Applied sorting algorithms to display candidates or states based on vote counts, ensuring accurate and efficient election outcome representation.
